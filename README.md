#### What?

An experiment in bridging [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/) and [Lastfm](http://www.rdio.com/) together.

The idea is to gather your most listened to artists on Rdio and generously gather similar talents from Lastfm comprehensive database.

All of this straight from your Android phone.

#### What does it look like?

It has pretty animations. It has blurring. It has large images.
